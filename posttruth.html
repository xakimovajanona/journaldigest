                    So, what is post-truth? How did it happen that you and I create it, and we suffer from it? First, what is post-truth?
Post-truth is when forming public opinion real facts matter less than emotions and personal beliefs. Or simply when the truth is no longer needed by anyone, and opinions that are not based on anything become more important.
<br>
<br>
The post-truth is sown mainly on the web, and the reason for trust in it is still the deep trust of people in the Internet. The Internet is relatively young, so we still contrast it with TV and newspapers, thinking that only here they say, albeit unpleasant, but the truth. The problem is that mostly this is not true. And people trust because they believe the authority of the speakers (bloggers, celebrities,influencers) and their emotions.
<br>
<br>
Here, for example, telegram channels. Honestly? I don't understand it at all. Some anonymous people, with unclear goals, who are not responsible to anyone for anything, say what they want and about whom they want, and readers believe it. Any, even the most jaundiced media understands its responsibility for every word spoken and, after all, "фильтруют базар", that is filter information. You can say anything in a telegram, and Pavel Durov won't even give out the author's IP address to go to court, because that's how he fights for "freedom of speech".
<br>
<br>
It's strange, but it always seemed to me that freedom of speech is not to say anything publicly about anyone, but to speak publicly based on proven facts, being aware and being ready to be responsible for what was said. Isn't it so?
<br>
<br>
But since truths and dry facts have become boring to us in such an information-rich era (new content is needed all the time), we are more willing to huddle around scandalous, impressive news. If they write about someone in the cart that he is a pedophile, then even if this person washes himself three hundred times with facts, people will still squint, saying "there is no smoke without fire." So much for the post-truth. 
<br>
<br>
People believe anonymous carts and comments in IG more than official media, big companies, etc., because: 
-companies, brands, official media are "cynical and corrupt", they always lie, but ordinary people in carts and blogs - no 
-it's more interesting to believe emotional stuffing, but to sit and search for the truth, to verify the facts - no 
- the one who is worse off is right, who has suffered, who has been infringed, and everyone who is "guilty" of this is automatically wrong. In the dispute "brand versus buyer" in the eyes of the public, the brand will always be to blame.
<br>
<br>
In general, the very idea that everyone can speak publicly and be heard is not bad in the beginning! Because this is real democracy, freedom of speech. When everyone can be heard, and the truth is not hidden for money and connections. Remember the scandals with Alsou, Todorenko, Galliano, Duma and Sergeenko. Internet opinion is rocking the boat so badly that it is gaining more and more influence on the course of development of any events. But how often is this public opinion based on carefully studied facts? Exactly.
<br>
<br>
You will say, "well, the villagers, corporations and politicians suffer from this, they find fault with their words and drown them in slander, and it serves them right! What's it to me?" The scariest thing is that the post-truth sooner or later concerns each of us, you don't have to be a Todorenko to be hounded in the parent chat for refusing to hand over money for plastic gifts. You can not send the marriage to the buyer, it is enough for the buyer to write about it in stories with tears, even if the product is 100% serviceable - they will believe him more. It is enough to pass the mark of 10K subscribers, as many of your words begin to be replicated and distorted.
<br>
<br>
These examples, by the way, prove that people generate post-truth not only because of their passion for fat news and mass lynchings of public figures, and sometimes just because of ignorance, misunderstanding of the essence. But the post-truth is inexorable: once they said it on the Internet and others repeated it, it means that it was so.
<br>
<br>
I think Trump is the most dexterous horseman of the post-truth era. It's not for nothing that he calls himself "Hemingway 140 characters", because he runs the country essentially through Twitter. How does it work? Trump, despite his dense age (he is 75), clearly understands that the fan of public opinion is always on, and it is impossible to protect him from throwing shit on him. What is important to do? It is important to have time to throw on the fan first. Donny himself produces hype statements and emotionally supported statements, and the media begin to replicate them. Yes, the statements are controversial, infuriating at times, but you can't shut up the Internet. so Trump gives him food from his hands, without waiting for others to turn him over.
<br>
<br>
The most striking example of post-truth in cinema is "Gone Girl" by Fincher. Do you remember how the swing of public opinion swung in relation to Affleck's character? The dude was just picking his nose while events were happening behind his back, but during this time he managed to be in the eyes of people a murderer, a vile husband, a savior and, as a result, a wonderful spouse who happily found a wife. And all this within the framework of Facebook and Twitter.
<br>
<br>
Does the Pattern replicate the post-truth? Undoubtedly. I didn't look under the hood of the Tesla, I didn't hold a candle over Lucas and Leo, and I didn't feel all of Cooper's "beards" with these hands. Yes, without hiding the label "one woman said", with jokes and bywords, we nevertheless sow information for which we are not responsible. And since we do it brightly and with taste, people believe. Because yes, authority and emotions. And who will check?)
