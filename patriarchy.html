                    Have you ever wondered why the world is predominantly patriarchal? And not only geographically (that is, territorially everywhere), but also chronologically - at all times (in general). Have you ever wondered why feminists came to light now, and not in the 15th century, say? What were they waiting for?
                    <br>

Everything is absolutely logical. But, as always, it is ground in the millstones of human ignorance, philistine myths and a little rewritten history here and there. So let's put everything back in its place? Let's start, of course, with Marx!
<br>
I will immediately dilute a small retro gossip: Marx and Engels were lovers. Well, the fact that Marx wrote and Engels paid his expenses is generally known to everyone. So what? Do you know how hard it is to create without a sponsor?! But there are rumors not only about their creative relations. And also Capital by Marx was one of my favorite books at the philosophy lectures. It's brilliant work! It's a pity that many people think that this is something about communism, Bolshevism and so on, it's a damn philosophy of economics! Just think about how romantic it is.
<br>
Karl Marx Capital Vol I. A Critique of Political Economy: Of course, an insane amount of thoughts and ideas are expressed in the book, but the simplest, school, so to say - about the basis and the superstructure, In fact, everything is very simple: how a society gets economic benefits (food in a broad sense) and divides them, such is its culture, hierarchy in society, and social institutions.
<br>
"But what does the patriarchy have to do with it, Janona?" you ask. That has everything to do with this!. But let's start with an abstract example, let's go a little into fantasy. Imagine that we all live with Sapiens descendants on a wild island and…
<br>
and food in our area can be obtained not by force, running, hunting, but, for example, with thin female hands in some narrow hollows. Men will not fit, only elegant women. There is no other food all over the earth, and this is the most delicious and high-calorie. Imagined? What's next? Yes, women forage for food all day long while men stay at home and work on the hearth. Is it logical? Women get and share food, the leader of the pack is a woman. What will these ancient people draw on the rocks? That's right: a female hunter with long thin arms and men obediently waiting by the hearth.
<br>
But, as we know, the main food of our ancestors was obtained by force, hunting, and chasing. Men are physically and at a hormonal level better built for this. Accordingly, the main earner throughout almost all of our history has always been a man. For this reason, the woman found herself in a dependent position. You ask "well, women could separate and eat mushrooms and berries, not depend on anyone". We could have, if nature hadn't made it so that women give birth.
<br>
During their entire short life (max 25-30 years), women either carried a child or fed it. Don’t have time for mushrooms, berries and politics, would you agree? And also add here male physical strength, which did not allow women, for example, to take away the food they got from men and divide it as they please. At the exit, we have the full power of the man's earner and the dependent position of the woman. And this happens naturally, not because someone decided so. Our physical inclinations and the way we procure food have self-determined our gender roles in the group.
<br>
Since the human economy has been predominantly agrarian or feudal for thousands of years (that is, there is no capital growth, no credit, no technology, you can't create an Apple out of nothing and get rich - only the inherited land was rich), the patriarchy has maintained its position for so long. Well right, that in the 3rd century BC men hunt and go to war, and women give birth, that in the 15th century AD. The world was traditional, the economy and roles too.
<br>
<br>
And now-the IQ test:<br><br>
What became a horseradish and entailed irreversible changes in our economy, and then-society and culture? And in fact shook the patriarchy?<br><br>
A)Science, technology, Capitalism <br>
B)The First feminists (suffragists) <br>
C)Sexual Revolution <br>
D)Social Networks<br>
<br>
<br>

That's right! The answer is A. It's just not all at once, of course. First, it was in the field of science  in Europe (the scientific method of Descartes, Newton, burned scientists), then it turned into technology (Western European civilization is the only one in history whose technologies are based on the scientific method, and not on empiricism). With technology came the growth of enterprises, the growth of capital, trade, and factually - the formation of capitalism. And so, for several centuries (in total!) humanity has come from a stone and a candle to a factory, a machine, a steamship and electricity. And what suddenly turned out to be?
<br>
Well, first of all, it turned out that you can get rich quickly and out of nothing. You find that whale oil burns, you equip the ship, you get rich. Until quite recently, it was only possible to get married or be born correctly for this, that's all. The growth of industry has led to the machine and women, because labor has become mechanical, accessible to more fragile creatures. And here it turned out (19th century onwards) that women are perfectly spanking at the machine, just like men (they could catch mammoths), but they still do not have rights and receive 10 times less.
<br>
What happened? The basis has changed rapidly (capitalism has replaced feudalism, agricultural and other manual mechanics have been replaced by industry and technology), and the superstructure has remained the same. Surprisingly, culture and society change more slowly than economics and technology. Do you know why? Because people have a memory. Traditions. It takes a change of many generations to destroy the tradition, and even that is not certain. The technique does not remember anything, so it changes quickly. A society with male laws simply refused to recognize that a woman also has some rights there. Haven't had a thousand years and once?
<br>
Many believe that the suffragettes were the first to change something. I disagree. At the end of the 19th century? When only a blind person didn't see the problem? If they had thrown clay pots in the 12th century and gone out for the right to fight, then yes, the avant-garde. In the 19th century, they became just the mouthpiece of the problem. And yes, the first feminists!
<br>
But the patriarchate was not going to give up its positions. Do you know why? Because at work, a woman may have become an equal to a man as an employee, but in everyday life… In everyday life, everything was very bad: no contraception, lack of household appliances, sexual ignorance, full-fledged service for all family members. That is, in fact, humanity has already flown into space, and women have flown into space, and come home, cook, wash, wash with your hands, and so on. Because you're a woman. How could the suffragettes help the cause?
<br>
The case moved totally from a dead point only at the moment of the colossal development of technology and the consumer sector (since the middle of the 20th century). Men, you yourself released the ladies from the age-old cages with your thirst for profit. They stuck vacuum cleaners, washing machines, semi-finished products and in fact freed women from the last chain of dependence - household. The basis was completely ready to accept a woman. But the superstructure still refused.
<br>
The last breakthrough was the Internet and the development of online professions/ interactions, etc. It turned out that everything: a woman is equal in her abilities to a man in work, and at the same time does not lead a heavy life (although she still leads).
<br>
Feminism has spoken loudly and clearly with only one simple request: if today a woman is not the nursing mother in a cave, waiting for her husband with a mammoth, and who will starve with her children, if her husband does not return, but a full-fledged worker, a professional and a person capable of raising offspring independently, then…
<br>
...then why the hell does society continue to treat us as if we are still in that cave? 
<br>
To think that feminists are imposing something on someone there (exclude radfem) - it's as naive as thinking that men invented patriarchy. Basis and superstructure. The economy is changing - the society is also changing. Who brings food, that's the head of the family. And in the 21st century it turned out that both bring food. A dilemma, right?
<br>
Easy excursion into our history, into the history of our species shows that patriarchy is not the law of the Sun, not the will of God, not a sign of fate, on the energy of the chakras: it's just the established order in a certain period of the history of the species due to certain factors. And when factors change, the orders also change.
<br>
Do you still think that gender equality was invented by nasty feminists in order not to shave their armpits? Then go to the most popular "but what about...?"
<br>

What about chess? “Women play chess worse, so they are naturally dumber”. Wrong. Chess is a set of moves played throughout the history of this game. Throughout our history, chess has been played mainly by men, so it was they who, based on their characteristic logic, thinking and type of decision-making, developed their defenses and sketches. A woman gets lost in them. If women had played chess for thousands of years and developed their own strategies, adaptive to their logic and thinking, men would also lose to us. Chess is a set of practices, not 2+2=4
<br>
Well, there are no great women scientists in mathematics, and 2 + 2 seems to be equal to 4 for everyone. Any reading person knows that reputation makes a genius. If the scientific community had not accepted Einstein's ideas and quoted them from book to book, there would have been no "great Einstein". Now imagine the citation index of a female scientist: until the 18th century she could not really study, and then if you imagine a brilliant mathematics student in the 19th century, it is impossible to imagine how the male scientific community recognizes, prints and quotes her works. Some of the ideas were simply rejected, some were taken without shame by men for their own works.
<br>
There are still purely male professions! There is. Due to the anatomy, a woman is unlikely to be a loader or a bouncer in a bar (please note - the key factor here is strength and anatomy). To become a surgeon, pilot or politician, a woman is hindered by the inertia of thinking of influential groups (well, some Qatar Airways will not take a woman as a pilot), lack of support on the ground, as well as physiological factors - a woman is often constrained by the birth and upbringing of children, which prevents her from advancing in a serious career. The uterus does not prevent a woman from becoming a pilot.
<br>
Fucked up fem agenda! And here I agree. It offends me that our desire to be evaluated by the result, and not by gender, is taken out in some separate direction. Like "here's your feminism, indulge". When a man decides to make a career or be independent, they don't say that this is a manifestation of masculinity. What the hell is feminism? But I understand that the radicalism of the movement is needed: people will hear only if they shout loudly.
<br>
But what about without patriarchy? I think if the patriarchy replaces the matriarchy, it will not be a step forward. Along with the development of technologies and capabilities, discussions, explanations, and enlightenment are needed.
