                    What is postmodernism?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                     In simple terms, this is a concept that denotes a whole layer of phenomena in society and culture in the second half of the 20th-early 21st century. That's all, but not everything is so simple.If there is some kind of "postmodern", then there is also a "modern", and therefore, probably, there is a pre-modern? Right, there is.
<br><br>
Yes, everything is extremely simple. The scheme works only for Western culture. So, everything before the 15th century (renaissance in art, the emergence of classical science) - this is pre-modern, with all the similar features for all ancient civilizations: man was created by God, a rigid hierarchy (man is just a grain of sand in the universe), faith in fatality and the forces of nature. In the 15th-16th century, classical science begins to emerge (the one with the scientific method, Newton, Descartes and Leibniz), and a person abruptly begins to realize that he is quite the crown of nature! And even able to conquer it!
<br><br>
What a man has not done in modernity!! If pre-modern can be compared with the childhood of mankind (when you listen to your parents and believe in the tooth fairy and babaika), then modern is definitely youth with its inherent maximalism! Man began to launch steamships, trains, electricity, and with them - to be freed from all the "parental" prohibitions of the past. Now Darwin doubted the theory of the creationists, and the Impressionists began to smear paints from tubes directly on the canvas - time marched at such a pace that the person himself could not keep up with it.
<br><br>
My beloved Nietzsche, who is rightly called the "forerunner of postmodernism", introduced such a concept into philosophy as nihil (nothing), which at some point (before we understand) marked the end of modernity and the beginning of postmodernity. Everything, all the fears, complexes and prejudices of the past have been destroyed, man has conquered nature, got rid of naive faith in higher powers, there is nothing to be cleansed of anymore. What's next? In art, this process of spreading out forms, started by the Impressionists, then picked up by the Cubists, Surrealists and Fauvists, which painting is marked?
<br><br>
That's right. "Black Square" by Malevich. And you all say "and I can draw it like that". It's a matter of context. In fact, the same artists, starting with the Impressionists, were trying to get away from the classical task of painting - to draw "as in life". Because photography appeared, painting could not compete in speed and accuracy with it. Therefore, experiments began at the end of the 19th century, such purely modernist attempts to get away from the canons, to find something new, but ultimately the cubic women and flat strokes of Kandinsky led to the fact that, as it turned out, there was nothing further. Nihil. And then... the postmodern begins! 
<br><br>
Postmodernism begins somewhere in the middle of the 20th century, when it becomes finally clear: the whole previous culture and history has come to be examined by a person under a magnifying glass, like the actions of parents-at the reception of a 40-year-old person with a psychologist. How to continue as it was, there is no point in creating a new one-it is unclear how. Technology has given us such a start (and we have been walking from a candle to electricity for thousands of years, and from a lamp to the Internet for only a hundred) that we simply do not understand where we are going. And what are we starting to do? That's right, take pieces of the old and mix them with a new sauce. And in everything: in art, in culture, in politics, in life. This is postmodern, baby (c)!!
<br><br>
The base of postmodernism is such concepts as: 
<br><br>
irony (when people create memes about Lukashenka and atrocities in Belarus - this is pure postmodern, the sacrality disappears, everything is subjected to irony) 
<br><br>
deconstruction (this is when, with the development of science and technology, we look at all our past experience under a magnifying glass, and now love is not what it is about than serenaded for centuries, but just the synthesis of 2-phenylethylamine (PEA).
<br><br>
Yes, the wedding of Sobchak and Bogomolov in a hearse is postmodern - because they are ironic about classical and sacred ideas about this ceremony (the rite), mixing images from Tim Burton's films there. Everything outrageous in art is also largely postmodern, because classical forms are not interesting in principle and have outlived themselves -they are replaced by performance, installation, happenings.
<br><br>

Profit of today's stories? Definitely there is! When you are once again charged for plagiarism (in works or content), say with a smart look, "this is postmodernism, baby, a culture that quotes itself"!
