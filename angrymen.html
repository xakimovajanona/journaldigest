                    «Life is in their hands - death is on their minds''. 12 Angry Men is a 1957 American film directed by Sidney Lumet, adapted from a 1954 teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose. This movie makes the audience think during and after the movie Is over. When the trial is over, twelve jurors have to decide whether or not the 18 years old boy is guilty of father’s murder.. However, whatever the verdict is, it should be unanimous. Sidney depicts the juror’s indifference, but if we dig a little bit deeper, we find the second bottom.

It was a scorching hot day when everyone was impatient to get this over with. Most of the jurors voted ‘guilty’, while only one of them decided not to fit in with the majority - Henry Fonda. At first, he had nothing to say, but he was not sure about the boy’s guilt. However, nobody had that certainty and none of them needed further exploration of the case, even though it was the matter of a man’s life. Their truth was just to accept everything the attorney and prosecutor brought up. Fonda, on the contrary, did not want to take on the death of possibly an innocent person without talking about it first. Step by step, Fonda could raise the same feelings in other jurors by directly asking each of them: «Could they be wrong?», «Do you know so?» and etc. After some tries of making the jurors doubt, Fonda decided to take a risky move - vote by secret written ballot. If there are eleven votes for guilty, they will take a guilty verdict to the judge. But if anyone votes not guilty, they will stay there and talk it out. Ten votes against one; one more juror doubted the guilt of the accused. Gradually, Fonda convinced more jurors that there is a room for doubt. When the votes were split evenly, juror #7 - who was not engaged in the discussion - changed his mind and said ’not guilty’. The only thing Jack was concerned about is the baseball game and this being the only reason why he voted ‘not guilty’. It is unbearable to argue with a person with that much indifference. However, if we dig deeper, we will find out other issues that arise from that indifference - social & personal prejudices and public irresponsibility.
This court session showcases how most of the juror’s decisions are based on their prejudices and personal experience. During the discussion, when the tension gets higher, juror #10 judges the boy by his broken English and says that people from slums are garbage. Meanwhile, the other juror is convinced of the boy's guilt, because he is sure of the depravity of the Z generation. However, the most important part the movie embraces is people’s irresponsibility. They would rather wait until Fonda changes his mind to ‘guilty’ to get done with it then truly investigate the case. In fact, irresponsibility of jurors was illustrated early in the beginning of the movie during the first vote. Although a man’s life was on the stake, everyone was looking at one another to choose what the majority chooses instead of thinking critically about the boy’s case.
As the movie closes, the not guilty verdict is handed down. Juror #8 looked at the scene broadly and made others do the same thing. Fonda could instill a sense of responsibility in the jurors and save the life of the innocent, or not. What is important , according to the movie, is that justice is ensured.
