                       What the Film is about?

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Giant 250 million dollar yacht goes on a cruise on the seas. All immensely rich individuals onboard, valets, room service staff at the bottom, and somewhere in between wavering social class - a couple influencers who got a chance to go sailing on a barter. 
                    At some point the sailing ship suffers a shipwreck, and a group of survivors - just like from a bad anecdote: wealthy russian, poor asian, silent Swedish jew, and a couple of those influencers - have washed ashore that have to pull through somehow.
                    The film is cleft into three parts, and, in my opinion, it is not aleatory. In the first part, our couple of influencers spend 20 minutes of screen time talking about which of them will pay the bill at the restaurant, throwing theoretical slogans about gender equality, which for some reason clearly slips in practice. 
                    In the second part, the same heroes fall from a world flavored with democratic myths for the poor into the real world - without the nonsense about "everyone is equal": on a luxury yacht, ugly, stupid and obviously not spiritually rich people have what all the insta-influencers of the planet Earth combined did not dream of, and emigrants from third world countries the worlds are clustered below, serving the most ridiculous whims of the rich.
                    In the third part, not only the social husk about equality and freedoms falls off, but in general any husk - even about social inequality: there is nothing to eat, nothing to drink and nowhere to sleep on a desert island. The director gives the characters (and the viewer along with them) a chance to reset all reference frames and see if they will come to a fairer arrangement in their microgroup than the one in which they had to live on the mainland. Or simply put: will they establish capitalism or communism, patriarchy or matriarchy on the island?
                    
                    I will immediately note that the film was average (I would have shot better), the dynamics sometimes clearly subsides, and the plot twists are not that straight "postmodern", although it pulls quite farce. Therefore, the most valuable thing in this film, of course, is not the story of the survival of modern consumers on the island, but how cleverly a thoughtful viewer is provoked to reflect on the world in which we live. I personally left the cinema hall with thoughts about pressing issues, which I propose to discuss in the wake of the film.

                    Capitalism vs Communism
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>


                    The main line of the film is, of course, fiery arrows towards capitalism, which is obviously unfair and gluttonous for everyone today as a system, but for some reason they still cannot find a replacement for it. A Russian oligarch selling shit (that is, manure) speaks for capitalism in the frame, and the captain of the ship, performed by Woody Harrelson, drowns for communism. They take out their notebooks and begin to pick on quotes that expose one system or another, even mentioning the famous quote of Lenin: "The last one we will hang is the capitalist who will sell us a rope". In fact, Lenin did not say this, just as he did not say half of what is attributed to him on the Internet. The quote is rather apocryphal.
                    
                    The director's intention is clear: he portrays the capitalist world intentionally ugly (what are the scenes with sick oysters) in order to cause even the most neutral-minded viewer (not such a Marxist as me and the captain of the ship) disgust and desire to somehow correct this inequality, and that's why he throws everyone on a desert island, where logically you can start from scratch and create anything. But for some reason, the survivors are in no hurry to unite into a group, although even from the head of the manure uncle, apparently deposited on the subcortex back in Soviet school, communist slogans from the series "from everyone according to their abilities, to everyone according to their needs" begin to involuntarily fly out, only the cleaner, who is the only one who knows how to fish and make a fire, clearly does not crave equality and revels in his power. AND - SPOILER - like any government will eventually come to violence for the sake of preserving itself.
                    
                    The director leads us inexorably to the fact that no matter how many capitalists you destroy, people will still come to the fact that someone will be smarter, nimbler, stronger, faster, seize power and authority, and that the inhabitants of the island will somehow come to the inequality that infringed on them on the mainland. I protest and disagree with the author.
                    Even my unloved propagandist Harari correctly described in his book Sapiens the whole logic of the effectiveness of groups: a person from the back of the food chain came to the top thanks to joining groups. And in reality (and not in the movies) on the island, people would also unite - corny to be stronger in the face of wildlife.And the difference between capitalism and communism is precisely that there and here people unite for the sake of the result in groups, only in the first case one takes the profit, and in the second it will be divided equally among all. In the first case, some will be insanely rich at the expense of others, in the second - everyone will be about equally poor.

                     Matriarchy vs Patriarchy

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    Acutely, though also slyly, my other favorite topic is touched upon in the film - gender equality and the prospect of matriarchy. I will allow myself one spoiler: matriarchy will indeed be established on the island at some point in time, and clearly mirroring patriarchy - with sexual and domestic exploitation of men by women.  And if I am still ready to argue with the author's hopelessness about capitalism, then the matriarchy depicted by him will definitely not be the way we are used to seeing patriarchy. Judge for yourself.
                    
                    The exchange of sex (the main need of the stronger sex) for satiety and security (the needs of a woman) was absolutely logical throughout almost all of our history, because marriage performed an economic function, not a romantic one (it became such only by the 19th century). Family ties and the birth of children closed utilitarian tasks: it was necessary to work on the land and transfer this land to posterity, so the man was the main earner in the family (he is physically stronger and not tied to childbearing), and the role of the woman was really tied exclusively to her fertility. The key here is not sex as a value, but that it is a value for the stronger (for a man) and he takes this value in exchange for something that is a banal necessity for the weaker (like, for example, shelter and food for a woman and her offspring). It is logical that if the strong and weak are swapped, then the objects of exchange will also change. But the director misses this important point and paints the matriarchy established on the island as the same exchange of sex for food that women have been forced to use for centuries, but excuse me, is it going to be like this on an island without offspring and cultivation of the land, where women got fish for themselves?
                    
                    In general, I would say that this historically formed exchange of sex for things even today in our still male world looks illogical, but it still remains at the level of the cultural code, as a tradition and norm, and in the most crooked form - like household duties, which for some reason are "female" and how-then they do not share equally in any way, even with equal earnings with a man, and also like a woman's duty to "satisfy a man's need", which, in my opinion, somehow reduces an independent woman to the status of a tool and a means, and that's all in the 21st century? Where is Greta Thunberg? Why is the girl silent about this?
                    
                    We debated with my family on this topic for a long time and came to the conclusion that if women really take away the need to give birth to children (for example, it will be done in a test tube) and give them full economic freedom in this regard (which is in many ways now), and establish matriarchy, then the last thing they will exchange their time, money and power, there will be sex. In such a world, it is more likely that all men's physical work will be dumped on men, and the ladies will be busy with communication, business and themselves. Well, either we just die out as a species.

                     Selling Shit vs Being an Influencer?

                     <br>
                     <br>
                    
                    To my shame, I realized only now the key secret of a successful business: it is built on real urgent demand with infinite return. This is the truth that McConaughey's character speaks about in the first scenes of The Wolf of Wall Street: come up with new ideas, new situations - new promotions, don't let the client jump off, spin him on the Ferris wheel. Indeed, this is the very returnability that forms the basis of the success of McDonalds, Zar and Amazons.
                    The guests from the yacht vividly illustrate this: they sell manure, weapons (and call it "means to preserve democracy"), and earn on the most faded, urgent and returnable. And not on telegram channels, advertising buyers with brand replicas. In the movie, the birds from the insta world, who found themselves on a yacht by the will of fate, are just well ridiculed: they wear expensive things by barter and ride on a yacht for photos, looking into the mouths of all these dung kings with real wealth and power.Many people have decided that the words of the Russian oligarch that he "sells shit" are metaphorical, but there is no special metaphor here: the world is real and has never ceased to be so, no matter how much we were going to fly to Mars. And money - they are not in the crypt, influencers and some other kind of lotion for the poor: they are in the land, food, medicines, fertilizers, chemistry and in the funeral business. The demand for this will exist as long as humanity exists, and the only business insight that can be caught is to get to those pieces of pie where you can milk this demand all your life. And there are only two ways there: Family or power. Both is better!)

                     What is the power?

                     <br>
                     <br>
                    
                    My friend and I recently debated on this topic for several hours and came to the conclusion that the most unstable systems are those where strength is on the side of both (rival colleagues, marriage where both work, strong territorial neighbors, etc.), and the most stable ones are those where there is clear subordination and strength on the side of one (for example, a very patriarchal marriage, a child is a parent, a boss is a subordinate, a weak colony is a strong hegemon). The film clearly leads to the idea that the truth is in force, and not vice versa, and I agree with horror with this.
                    This power looms in the plot at all levels. In the first part, the characters quarrel over the bill at the restaurant just because none of the two is significantly stronger than the other. If the lady had a richer gentleman (a shit dealer, for example), then there would be no conflict: he would generously pay her bills, the lady would generously pay for it in the bedroom. But in our pair of heroes, the strength is not defined and tension sets in.
                    My sister said that my analysis is a hundred times more interesting and deeper than the film, but here I will defend the authors and say that the task of art is not to give answers, but to ask questions. There are a lot of questions in the "Triangle", but you will have to look for answers yourself, or wait until they are given by Greta Thunberg, Yuri Loza and other modern arguers.
                    In conclusion, I want to say that the author is either a wild misanthrope, or a pessimist, or just a troll, but he does not see any chances for other options for our joint existence, except for capitalism, patriarchy and force, as I understand it. I cannot say that I am a desperate optimist who believes in a bright communist future with women at the head, but I am almost sure that these forms of our associations into groups are clearly stormy and they will be forced to change. And you?
