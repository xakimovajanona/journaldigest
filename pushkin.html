                    So, there is a theory according to which Alexander Sergeevich Pushkin did not actually die in a duel, but faked his own death. After that he went to Paris and became famous already as the French writer Alexandre Dumas. What do they say in defense of this incredible theory?
                    <br><br>
All biographers note Pushkin's rebellious and adventurous spirit; he adored duels, carousing and cards. He was an absolute zero in the exact sciences. And was a rare womanizer. The main biographer of Dumas, Andre Mauroy, writes the same thing about Dumas: a rebel, a womanizer, a carouser, without abilities for algebra and physics. Alexanders are similar in appearance.
<br><br>
Here are images with a difference of 15 years. Pushkin could fatten up during this time. We take into account that Afro with blue eyes are extremely rare, and both were exactly like that! But how could Pushkin arrange his "death" and a secret departure to Paris?
<br><br>
Quite easy, considering that there are many inconsistencies in Pushkin's death and funeral. For example, the funeral service was scheduled in St. Isaac's Cathedral, but everyone was deliberately deceived - the body was secretly transferred at night to the Stable Church. After that, the coffin was lowered into the basement of the church and kept there for a week, and then secretly sent to Pskov, as a result, no one saw the dead Pushkin. And the wound itself raises questions: on the one hand, the bullet wounded the femoral neck and hit the stomach - at that time the wound was fatal, but in general the doctors could cope. And what if Pushkin really survived? But why did he need to fake his death at all?
<br><br>
Here, too, everything speaks in favor of this crazy theory. Pushkin had huge debts at the end of his life, he began publishing Sovremennik to correct the financial situation, but only incurred losses. The authorities did not favor him, and just shortly before the duel, his mother passed away. Nothing held Pushkin in his homeland, but that's not all. Who remembers what nickname he had at the lyceum?
<br><br>
Thatâ€™s right! "Frenchman". Pushkin spoke French almost better than Russian and wrote many of his works for fun first in French. He loved France and in theory would feel great in his new homeland. So far, all converge at one point. But here the question arises about Dumas, where was he while Pushkin lived in Russia?
<br><br>
Dumas appears in Paris about 7 years before the Pushkin Duel and presents himself to everyone as the son of the previously famous, but at that time deceased General Tom- Alexander Dumas, and seeks protection from his father's associates. Well, everyone remembered that Dumas had an Afro son, but who could verify whether it was him at all? The theory says that long before the duel Pushkin began to lead a double life, presenting himself in Paris as Dumas for the sake of the game. Proponents of the theory compare the dates of Pushkin's long departures and come to the conclusion that he really could have been in Paris at that time.
<br><br>
There is even an interesting moment: just in the year when Pushkin married Goncharova, a note about the death of Dumas appeared in one of the French newspapers. Perhaps this is how Pushkin wanted to end his second life in Paris? If we take all these intricacies on faith, then it is not difficult to accept other facts about the similarity of the two Alexanders.
<br><br>
Here the similarity of the handwriting has always finished me off. As they say, "and you can fake a mustache," but the handwriting... the handwriting is just the architecture of the personality, and these two murals are almost identical!
<br><br>
Surprisingly, before Pushkin's death, Dumas did not really give out a single stellar novel. But after his death he became a truly famous French writer. And who remembers the name of the main character in " Graph Monte Cristo" in Dumas' novel? Yes, Edmond DANTES! Did not Pushkin hint with the help of his hero's story that he was reincarnated after his "death"?
At school, this story seemed just incredible to me. but today I... in short, I'm Janona, I'm 19 and yes, I still believe in it a little. And that's why: Pushkin was a gambler, a writer, an adventurer, through the years it just seems impossible, but then-no chips, no credit history, no serious passports, it was not so difficult to pull off such a thing. It seems to me that in spirit it was quite close to him. But as it really was, we are unlikely to find out. Do you believe in the version?
