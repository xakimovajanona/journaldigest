                    I'll start with a question: do you notice how you are getting older day by day, or how your child is gaining in height? Not every day. But looking at a year-old photo, you clearly see the changes. It's the same with information: it imperceptibly permeates our personality every day. It just seems to us that we have read the news and formulated our opinion about it. In fact, this opinion is formed in us over the years through millions of messages. In fact, we are the product of propaganda, always, and not only political, but also commercial, household, etc. 
<br>
<br>
But how does propaganda work if in some cases we notice and ridicule it, and in others we believe it unconditionally?
<br>
<br>
Propaganda is not a lie! 
<br>
This is probably the key thing to understand. Although in the era of photoshop, video editing and fakes, I already doubt that there is no obvious lie in the course of propaganda. And yet propaganda is not a lie. Propaganda is building the right facts in the right sequence to create the right picture of events and the right opinion about it. Here is a very simple example:
In the city of N with a population of 100 thousand people, 5 people fell ill with a rare disease. Let's say you are a media outlet that wants to inflate the scale of the disaster. In this case, you will shoot reports about all the patients, interview their relatives and neighbors, doctors and nurses who treated them. Create a feeling for the viewer that the disease is “everywhere". Perhaps you will even go to a neighboring city, find one of the same patients there and say that “there are already a lot of patients.” The picture you are creating: there is an epidemic in the city.
<br>
Let 's imagine a different situation . In the city of N with a population of 100 thousand people, 5,000 people have fallen ill with a rare disease, and you are the media that wants to hide the scale of the problem. You do reports and interviews with “non-ill people”, interview passers-by on the streets who, lo and behold, also “do not get sick”, citizens who “have not heard anything”, doctors who “have not encountered such patients".  To be truthful, you interview one or two patients who "are more likely to be ill with something else," and in general "it is not yet clear what exactly they are ill with." The picture you are creating: in the city, mostly everyone is healthy.
In both cases, there is no lie as such, but you will agree that each of the two “truths" is very doubtful. The credibility of any of the versions will be based precisely on the fact that something in it is certainly true, and this is the biggest propaganda trap: only “something” is true in it, not everything. We are led to this truthful “something”, simultaneously eating everything else with it.  But who creates these “versions” seasoned with facts? This is the second important point.
<br>
Propaganda always has a beneficiary.
<br>
Well, the one who benefits from you thinking that way. Simply put, the one who pays for it. Everything is clear with the federal media: they are paid for by the state, and their task is to inspire citizens with, if not joy from the party line, then at least peace. So that no one twitched, panicked, hung himself or caused riots. The desire of the state (and indeed of any large institution) for everyone to sit straight is to some extent justified. But only to some extent.
And what about the Internet, independent media and bloggers? People trust them because there is an illusion that they are “independent” for that, that no Kremlin pays for their position and they voluntarily, apparently living off bread and water, are looking for the truth. I'll tell you a secret: “independent” media do not depend, as a rule, only on the state.  But they always depend on their key sponsors, shareholders, who - surprise - often work for the same state, and even more often - for someone else's.
Someone pays for any qualitatively and methodically formed opinion on the Internet. If someone collected facts for you, formed an opinion on them, showed everything, filmed, edited, edited and so on a regular basis for years - why did he do it, for what? What did he and his team eat while they were creating this material? In one word, "look for who pays". It's especially funny, as after disabling monetization on the same YouTube, the materials of “independent” bloggers and channels continue to come out without loss of quality and pace.
Promised to be neutral, but I'll show on my fingers who feeds the most popular “independent” media and channels. 
<br>
So:
<br>
The Bell, Elizaveta Ossetinskaya: The European Foundation for Democracy Support (EED), the disgraced Zimin Dynasty Foundation, the Polestar Digital Ventures Foundation of the University of Brackley
The project, Roman Badanin: the George Soros Open Society Foundation and the same Berkeley 
Medusa: OAK Foundation, government agency SIDA 
Rain: Sreda Foundation (UK), Sindeeva: "They (the EU) order us programs "Russia is Europe" that promote European values."
Redefine (Spletnik. The Village, Wonderzine) - recently, Sindeeva's husband Sasha Vinokurov owns everything (Well, further down the list, I think everyone knows this without me)
In fact, in this paragraph, one could end the story about propaganda by saying that as soon as you find those who pay for the material, it will become clear to you how propagandistic their opinion will be and how right or left their "truth" will be. But I will continue, because after we realized that any propaganda is a deliberately formed "truth" for someone's money and in someone's interests, it remains to be understood: how do we choose to believe one propaganda without noticing it, and not to believe another, despising it for imposing?
<br>
How do we choose the truth we will believe in?
In fact, a whole scientific investigation can be launched here, because for me it is somewhere beyond the explicable: as two conditional moms living in the same country and in the same city, having approximately the same income and standard of living, the same age, performing approximately the same household and child care duties every day, reading the same news in the same conditional instagram ... choose to believe in the end is not that different, but almost opposite versions of events?
Here, I think, there is a short answer that sounded earlier in the story about the post-truth: we choose emotions. Where emotions pull more, we believe in it more. The only question is that we all have different injuries, pain and emotional triggers. The twitchers are different, but the principle is the same.
People with a tendency to depression and panic attacks are more likely to cling to the version of the apocalypse and the coming end. Tenacious businessmen are more likely to join the more optimistic camp of thought, convincing themselves that everything will be tip-top. Note that neither of them will get closer to understanding the truth.
People with assets in the West will be inclined to believe Ossetian, who are doing well here, will instinctively begin to defend their homeland, because they do not want to associate their place of residence with a threat. And so on the list: your education, experience, social circle, intelligence, outlook, standard of living, psychological profile, as well as everything that was put into your head in movies, on the Internet, in books and newspapers - all this will determine your choice of what to believe. And you don't have to convince yourself that you haven't been brainwashed, you've been thinking with your own head. Well, well.
Honey, – he said, – you have five thousand marketers in your head for ten years, and you want me to clean it up in five minutes..

And how not to become a victim of propaganda?
<br>
If we start from the fact that there is nowhere to hide from information, there will always be a lot of it and it will always be very different, and none of us has the time, resources, knowledge, or connections to sit 24/7 with books, maps, statements from the accounts, in order to seek out the truth, then what to do? How not to become a victim of propaganda?
The short answer is no way. The ideal - a state close to Socratic “I know I don't know anything” is practically unattainable, as it is impossible to just take, sit on the sofa, think carefully and bang - find the truth! Therefore, the minimum task is to learn how to catch the main propaganda techniques and distance yourself from them.
A bonus for those who have reached this place is propaganda techniques based on the example of the current situation.
Western and pro-Western (that is, Russian-speaking left-wing) propaganda works better than ours, alas. It is more artistic, bright, similar to Marvel (these are good, these are bad, good must defeat evil, evil exists for no reason by itself). It is very cinematic and strongly affects emotions. People believe artistic stories about evil and good more than boring dry facts. The picture catches and is remembered more than the text. 
If the information is presented to you in bright pictures and images - do not be fooled, this is propaganda.
By Western propaganda, I mean, of course, not only the USA and the EU, but also Ukraine: about 150 PR agencies in London and the USA work for it today, including Edelman, APCO Worldwide, Hill+Knowlton Strategies, Weber Shandwick, Ketchum, Havas PR Global Collective, ICF Next, Zeno Group, Finn Partners, Publicis Groupe, MSL and others. There are also publications of the Financial Times, the oppositional The Guardian, the liberal The New York Times, the centrist Corere Della Sera, the kringy Bild and others.
A different point of view should be turned off wherever possible, without allowing any alternative or independent versions in the media space. As soon as you find out about our disabled media in the West, or about the disabled Western media in our country, or you see that the channel/blogger/account defends only one point of view, calls for interviews only those who support this point of view, and covers only those events that support it - don't be fooled, it's propaganda.
In military propaganda (in today's cinematic in particular), it is very important to polarize images, as I said earlier - in a Marvel way. On the one hand, there are always good, bright unicorns and ponies, on the other - orcs, demons and barbarians. In peacetime, such an alignment of forces is more likely to make the viewer laugh, in wartime, when there is too much information and everyone is scared, it works fine. Remember, each of the parties has both logical reasons to act like this, and sins that need to be hidden. If you see unambiguous evil or white good - don't be fooled, this is propaganda.
A distinctive feature of military propaganda is the absence of any rationality in the plots about the enemy, while in the real world everything is more prosaic, mundane and logical. If you see news about events and actions devoid of any logic, except “because these are bad” or “because those are good” - don't be fooled, this is propaganda.
<br>
The degree of horror from more and more new pictures should go on increasing. One separate provocation lives for three to five days, then interest in it drops, the information space is filled with a new impressive story. In general, all military propaganda is impossible for a long time, since there is a limit to human emotional involvement: eventually the viewer's brain gets used to horror and stops reacting to it. Therefore, the task of each of the parties is to invest as much as possible in the game during the first three to six months. After six months, propaganda stops working completely. And yes, if you are attacked every time with new horrors exactly every week as scheduled - do not be fooled, this is propaganda.And last, most important, you need to stop believing that there is some unambiguous truth. And that someone will tell you it with a proper search: Nastya from the pattern, Ekaterina Shulman, RBC, The Bel, Katz or Simonyanl. The truth in politics, alas, is an extensible concept, and belongs to the one who has the power. And not vice versa, alas. "If you want to know the truth, no one will tell you. They will tell you only their version. If you want to know the truth, you'll have to find it yourself.“ — Julian Assange. If someone says “now I will tell you the whole truth” - don't be fooled, this is propaganda.
