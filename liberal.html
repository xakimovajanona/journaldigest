                    Who is Liberal?

In simple words, a liberal is someone who puts individual freedom and human rights above the state. A patriot (and we will come to patriotism later) is the one who puts a motherland/ state above his individual human desires.
The liberal view of the world is formed not abstractly - from emptiness or by bright people in white, but historically. This is happening in Western European discourse at the stage of the expansion of capitalism (cursed) around the 18th century, because the free market gave people more opportunities to realize their freedom - without a caste system, already with some kind of elective power and no social elevators.
It sounds tempting, but even then, at the dawn, as always with liberals, everything was stuck in contradiction: it seems that the free market and capitalism allowed us to talk about freedoms, but capitalism and the free market itself stood on exploitation, colonies and brothels with children who slept on ropes and died from winding poisonous phosphorus on matches. 
<br>
"You continue spinning here, and we will fight for your freedoms".
<br>
A certain populism is always inherent in liberal statements, while it is absolutely impossible to argue with them. There is always such an infinity of discussion, because who in their right mind would argue against freedoms? As a result, liberalism is always such a parallel to the harsh reality of the chant for everything good and against everything bad, tenacious, like a cockroach after a nuclear explosion (no offense to anyone, purely metaphorical).
<br>
<br>

Why does liberalism only criticize?

<br>
<br>
Well, in short, because it does not create anything. You can't get away from reality, you can't get away from the physical world either (at least for now), so any program of organizing the life of society will always stand on how we produce goods and how we distribute them among ourselves (hello, Marx). Capitalism has such a program, communism has it, and feudalism has it, liberalism does not have it.
Liberalism is such a "Moon-satellite of the Earth", which always runs parallel to the working course and, in fact, is needed to prevent the system from becoming stagnant, to criticize, bite and shake it a little. And in general, it's even good.
After all, what is the ideal liberal concept? This is a younger, more progressive view of the gaps in the stagnant system. A liberal wants to improve what works, where it works, for those around him. Ultimately, this is a patriot, not an emigrant from Israel, broadcasting about Russia with US money. For example, the struggle for the introduction of sex education in school instead of lessons about the Bible is the right liberalism. Yes, it shakes the patriarchal foundations somewhere, but teaching the younger generation this part of life is useful for the future of the country: this way there will be less sexual violence due to the removal of stigma, early pregnancies and abortions, domestic sexual exploitation, etc.
But the incident of liberalism is that it can't stop at some point and say something like "there are enough freedoms, we don't go on sitting." In general, this is an incident of any system: in the beginning, both capitalism, communism, and Christianity as systems are ideal, but sooner or later their idea begins to devour them. Because to say a safe word means to betray the idea of the system itself. So, my example of the liberalism of a healthy person with sex education lessons can be promoted to the liberalism of a smoker: first we fight for the right of young people to get knowledge about sex, then we fight for the right to get knowledge about sex that is not encouraged, then we say, why do we tell girls about love for boys at all, and how is it their freedom not to be girls? And further along 150 genders. And a safe word not to say, because liberalism cannot restrict freedom!)
<br>
<br>

What's wrong with liberal values today?

<br>
<br>
This is the endless struggle for freedoms and it leads to the fact that the very freedoms that have already been fought for are being replaced by fictional freedoms, because ... we have to fight for freedoms all the time. As a capitalist - to increase capital, and as a Christian - to repent more and limit yourself. But the worst thing is that liberalism, as a product of capitalism, ultimately cannot do anything about its vices, because it itself stands on it. And instead of fighting for the rights of children on Starbucks plantations in Indonesia, who would really like to get rid of exploitation, get the right to education and medicine, the liberal allegedly does not notice this, and fights for the right of well-fed children of the West to change gender and be non-binary. Struggling with a Starbucks latte in his hand, of course.
That is, everything turns into a simulacrum (copy that pretends to be the original), where there seems to be a struggle for freedoms and a challenge to the system, but there is no way to change the system itself. If you simply eradicate the system that generates the problems that the liberal is struggling with, then, as you understand, there will be a situation in which the liberal suddenly has a working pass to the Nike factory in his hands instead of a latte.
By the way, the calls for "no war" from the consuming liberal class are just as contradictory, because those same Zara culottes are new every month, and the bottles from the HMM Home, and the opportunity to freelance online, and not at the factory to work, and chill on a weekend in Barsu and stand on the fact that where - that is, cheap labor, and not because someone "believed in himself." And it is the struggle for the cheapness of this resource that generates war and discrimination. The war always goes in a bag with a bag from McDonald's, crying about the departure of which, the liberal says "no to war." Society feels this hypocrisy and begins to make fun of it. So, a proud liberal at some point turns into a libtardl (a nasty word), a communist becomes a "commie", an entrepreneur becomes a "damned capitalist", a believer becomes "the Orthodoxy of the brain". All these terms signal that the representatives of these systems are rotten themselves.
<br>
<br>

Domestic liberal: what is he like?

<br>
<br>
In our domestic discourse (let's get away from these bourgeois, I'm tired of them already, liberalism in general always goes in fierce opposition to patriotism, because it did not grow like them, FROM capitalism, but TO SPITE the system. Our liberal is always such a Baryshnikov, fleeing in 1974 from the Union to the new wonderful world of the West, Coca-Cola and McDonald's (escaped and period)). For all my dislike of Baryshnikov, I have to admit: then it really was audacious, because it was dangerous, because no one knew what was waiting for you there. The rigidity of the Soviet system was high, in fact, and the protest against it was no less defiant. Ultimately, this is how it happened with us that anyone who is against the system is a progressive liberal, and the one who agrees with everything is a stuffy patriot. And all the current people flying to Yerevan just think that they are flying in the same plane as Baryshnikov to Canada 48 years ago (no). I believe that this division into liberal/patriot is unhealthy, strained and generously paid to strengthen the opposition (ideally, as we remember, a real liberal loves his country, and a real patriot does not resist changes - if it's better that way). But the patriot, with the help of all this "foreign" fraternity and Soviet history, is drawn by means of markers such as "zomboyashchik / beer at the dacha/ turkey/Дом два / Putin/ beggar". The liberal stands on the markers "awareness/Western values/ intelligence/ yoga/ latte/ garbage separation". In the end, it forms into 2 different consumption models, and people choose from them not for the essence that these ideas carry, but for their form. "If I'm a progressive person, then I'm a liberal," Vestimo. That is why this raises questions from the series "how can such a smart girl be for Pu?" although the mind is, first of all, the ability to analyze and make an autonomous and independent conclusion and choice. If your "mind" comes with "liberality", and you are a liberal, because "all smart people are liberals", then this raises questions. To the mind.
<br>
<br>
“The main idea that a person is trying to convey to others is that he has access to a much more prestigious consumption than they might have thought about him. At the same time, he tries to explain to others that their type of consumption is much less prestigious than they had the naivety to think. All social maneuvers are subordinated to this. Moreover, only these questions cause people persistent emotions”. B. Pelevin Empire V
<br>
<br>
Since the modern world, in fact, turns the once progressive liberalism only into a dam to divert the stale waters of capitalism, rests against the ceiling and begins to limit society with its endless freedoms (the culture of abolition is just from here: oh, are you against transgender people? Then we are coming to you), and in our country it also deliberately splits the general desire for a normal life in its country into "smart against" and "zombie for", I believe that it exhausts itself, like everything that reaches the stage of postmodernism and deconstruction.
<br>
<br>

Is patriotism the new vanguard?

<br>
<br>

The "progressivity" of liberalism is evaporating before our eyes, because it becomes obvious that Greta Thunberg cannot change the environment by skipping school lessons - for this it is necessary to reduce consumption, production and exploitation. Endless encouragement of gender variability will ultimately only strengthen gender contradictions, and not vice versa, and so on in everything. That is, this liberal struggle for freedoms demonstrates that it is in fact engaged only in its "struggle for freedoms", and is not able to change anything significantly, because it is possible to change something only through organization, rigidity, duty, public association, and not through separation. So postmodernism is crushing liberalism to the last, and a new round begins to emerge. This time - patriotic. (In principle, we can say "conservative", but in our case "patriotic" is juicier)
The "new Patriot" is still crooked, he exists to spite a bored liberal, and timidly (because it's still unfashionable to be a patriot) looks towards the magical west, starting to wonder how in that tik-tok "maybe I'm actually doing well ...?" While this still generates a number of contradictions, somewhere - ridicule and a senseless struggle of opinions, but still today it is the best way to return to balance.
I wrote in those "fractal" remarks that understanding what is happening around is the basic mechanism of orientation in society, that's how it is here: grounding, awareness that "this is my place and I will build on it for my children", that sometimes there is a public need, not just an individual one I want- all this not only allows you to actually build and change something, but also relieves anxiety for the future by giving some unrealistic amounts of dopamine. Personally, I felt it as a new kind of pleasure hitherto unknown to me.
