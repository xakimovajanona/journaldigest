                    The participants of the brain building club were divided into two groups: Western thinking and Eastern thinking. The heated discussion lasted more than an hour, which reminded me very much of the scene from the movie "12 angry men”, where all the furious and sweaty men from the heat (discussions) decide whether the defendant is guilty or not.  
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
The topic of our debate was the film "Dune”, the main character of which was Paul Atreides - a young man full of idealism and maximalism. The young man is trying to understand his adult and autonomous place in this world. Parents: In this movie, the symbol of the father is given by mom, and the symbol of the mother is given by dad. The father gives unconditional acceptance and protection (Mother's symbol), and the mother keeps trying to develop superpowers in her son and punch him an honorable place in society (Father's symbol)

The Emperor sent them to a new planet, the colonizers of which were cruel to the local population. Our heroes want peaceful coexistence with the local population and mutually beneficial cooperation instead of total seizure of resources.  
<br>
<br>

The local population is mysterious and attractive. They have incredible eyes, they live in complete harmony with nature, and even with their terrible climate, they are freedom-loving and principled.  
<br>
<br>

The young man's teacher tells about the thinking of the locals and the peculiarities of the desert: "they are part of the desert, and the desert is part of them”" "a truly perverted need for a reasonably organized, logical and orderly universe has taken root deep into the subconscious of people. But the fact is that the real universe is always, even one step ahead of Logic”" They are not trying to enslave the universe by taking control of its rules. In the film, we are shown the clash of two minds. The thinking of the East is when a person proceeds not from a goal, but from a potential - when a person recognizes in advance his limitations and insignificance on the scale of history. From the Thinking of the West, based on the seizure of resources, control and power, a person does not come from the potential, but from the goal. Metaphorically, Eastern thinking corresponds to the symbol of the Mother, and Western thinking corresponds to the symbol of the Father. Both symbols are developed inside the floor.  Having got acquainted with Eastern Thinking on this planet, he did not confront it like others, but integrated it into himself, becoming very flexible and very strong: the adaptability of the East, and the purposefulness of the West.
